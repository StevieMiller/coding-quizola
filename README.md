# Coding Quizola

## Description
This coding quiz was an assignment from coding bootcamp. I found this assignment to be very challenging and despite a lot of effort and tutoring, I was not able to code the functionality that this application required to meet acceptance criteria. I was able to get the first question to display but couldn't figure out how to render the following questions and answers. I was able to include a timer but couldn't get the logic to subtract time from the timer. I hope that I am able to return and finish this at a later date.
